        <p>The Royal Air Force (RAF) Spitfire is a British single-seat fighter aircraft used during World War II and other conflicts. It was designed by Reginald Mitchell of Supermarine Aviation Works in 1934, and more than 20,000 Spitfires were produced over the following two decades.</p>
        <p>The Spitfire is known for its sleek design, outstanding performance, and role in defending Britain against German air raids during the Battle of Britain. Its elliptical wing design and Rolls-Royce Merlin engine gave it exceptional speed and maneuverability, making it a formidable opponent in aerial combat.</p>
        <p>Today, the RAF Spitfire is an iconic symbol of British aviation and a cherished piece of history. Many Spitfires are still in operation and can be seen at airshows and museums around the world.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The Spitfire was developed in response to a British Air Ministry specification for a new fighter aircraft.</li>
            <li>The first Spitfire prototype flew in 1936, and the aircraft entered service with the RAF in 1938.</li>
            <li>During World War II, the Spitfire played a key role in the Battle of Britain and other air campaigns.</li>
            <li>After the war, the Spitfire continued to serve in various capacities, including as a trainer and reconnaissance aircraft.</li>
